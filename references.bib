	abstract = { Mesh clients in hybrid wireless mesh networks can perform the routing functionality, as well as provide end-user applications that are more suitable for tunnels, to improve the connectivity of backbone networks. In this article, based on the diversity of data and limited power supply of mesh clients in hybrid wireless mesh networks in underground mines, we propose a multi-criteria routing metric to support data-differentiated service. This routing metric divides data into two types: urgent and non-urgent. End-to-end delay is calculated when transmitting urgent data, and hop count and link load are measured when transmitting non-urgent data. In order to optimize the utilization of mesh clients and to prolong the network lifetime, mesh clients and mesh routers are given different weights in the calculation of hop count. Based on the QualNet7.1 simulation platform, the performance of the proposed routing metric in transmitting urgent and non-urgent data is evaluated through numerous simulations. Simulation results indicate that the routes selected using the proposed routing metric can effectively reduce the average end-to-end delay when transmitting urgent data and reduce the utilization rate of mesh clients while simultaneously guaranteeing the capability of the network when transmitting non-urgent data. This finding satisfies the differentiated service requirements of data of different types for hybrid wireless mesh networks in coal mines. }

	abstract="A mobile ad-hoc network (MANET) is composed of mobile nodes without any infrastructure where member nodes easily can leave or join the network. This issue provides a dynamic topology network such that providing quality of service and multicast services are very challenging tasks. The majority of applications of MANETs are in rapid deployment and dynamic reconfigurations. For these reasons, in this paper, we present an efficient fuzzy logic based multicast routing scheme to adaptively manage the network resources without any prior knowledge about network traffic. Every source node self-organizes the multicast session by using average end to end delay and packet delivery ratio parameters in order to dynamically adjust its own sending rate. The proposed method is a novel framework for multicast services such that it can be deployed by both tree-based and mesh-based multicast routing protocols. In addition, The proposed method uses a cross-layer technique to efficiently manage the congestion. The results show high improvement in terms of number of the retransmissions, delay, packet delivery ratio and overhead compared to the existing multicast schemes.",
